## Done

* Cell passage was done on THP-1 cells.

* Checked conditions of cells, and counted them

*  Primers were ordered to detect CCR2 and CCR5 genes. CCR2 primers were designed to be on exon-exon junctions. Two separate primers were ordered for CCR5 (CCR5_8 -- coding sequence; and CCR5_10 -- exon-exon junction)

*  THP-1 RNA was isolated using RNA extraction kit

*  RNA counted using NanoDrop machine

## Comments

THP-1 cells are AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) cells, a monocytic immortal cell line. THey are grown in 37 $^{\circ}C$, 5% $CO_{2}$. They are fed with RPMI 1640 (with additional supplements like antibiotics, heat-inactivated calf serum, etc.).
