## Done

* Repeating PCR experiment with double the concentration of RNA (this time 4 ${\micro}L$ was used).


## Results

* Both CCR2 and CCR5 seem to be expressed. CCR2 is visibly more expressed than CCR5.

## Comments

CCR2 and CCR5 transcripts seem to be present in the cell. Why does this not translate to the experimental results from flow cytometry? 

CCR5 might be regulated post-transcriptionally.
