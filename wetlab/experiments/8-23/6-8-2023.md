## Done

* Cell counting on cells for Flow Cytometry

* Used Flow Cytometry to detect expression of membrane proteins CCR2 and CCR5

## Results

* CCR2 was expressed to cell surface.

* CCR5 wasn't expressed to a significant degree to be detected more than noise.

## Comment

Since it's my first time doing flow cytometry preparation, lack of detected CCR5 signal might be attributed to technical problems.
