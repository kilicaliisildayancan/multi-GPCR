## Done

* Stocked ordered primers to 50 ${\micro}M$ concentration with DEPC-treated water.

* PCR reaction with primers to detect CCR2 and CCR5 transcript expression in THP-1 total RNA, used EEF2 primers as positive control.

* Ran gel with PCR products.
  
## Results

CCR2 and CCR5 seem to be expressed (albeit not a high level) in the cells.

## Comments

We decided here to repeat the experiment with higher concentration of cellular RNA
