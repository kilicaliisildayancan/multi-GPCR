## Done

* Repeated flow cytometry experiment from 8-8-23, with additional internal staining, and checkinig CD14+ human monocytes (from blood).

## Results

* CCR2 is both expressed in external and internal (the signal is not very clear) comparments of THP-1 cells.

* CCR5 is neither expressed in external nor internal comparments of THP-1 cells.

* CD14+ cells don't have either CCR2 or CCR5. **I might have killed them while preparing

## Comments

Like noted above (**), CD14+ results are probably not reliable, and we will have to repeat them to conclude something about CD14+ cells.
