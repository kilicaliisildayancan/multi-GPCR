## Done

* Received new primers, these allow detection of isoforms of two proteins (CCR2A or CCR2B; CCR5A, CCR5B, or CCR5C) and the detection of the bi-chemokine receptor mCCR2-5

* Synthesized cDNA from RNA of THP-1 cells and M0 cells.

* Using macrophage (M0 differentiated THP-1 cells - with PMA) and THP-1 RNA, did PCR reaction with new and old primers.

## Results

## Comments

Next time, running a gel on PCR products.
